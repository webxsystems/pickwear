This EULA governs your rights and obligations regarding the SmartEyeglass SDK of SONY and/or its third party licensors (including SONY's affiliates) and their respective affiliates (collectively, the "THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS"), together with any updates/upgrades provided by SONY, any printed, on-line or other electronic documentation for such software, and any data files created by operation of such software (collectively, the "SOFTWARE").  If you agree to be bound by this EULA on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full 
legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to this EULA.  If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept this EULA or use the SOFTWARE on behalf of your employer or other entity.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any software in the SOFTWARE having a separate end user license agreement (including, but not limited to, GNU General Public license and Lesser/Library General Public License) shall be covered by such applicable separate end user license agreement in lieu of the terms of this EULA to the extent required by such separate end user license agreement ("EXCLUDED SOFTWARE").

SOFTWARE LICENSE
The SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and international treaties.

COPYRIGHT
All right and title in and to the SOFTWARE (including, but not limited to, any images, photographs, animation, video, audio, music, text and "applets" incorporated into the SOFTWARE) is owned by SONY or one or more of the THIRD-PARTY 
SUPPLIERS.

GRANT OF LICENSE
SONY grants you a limited license to use the SOFTWARE solely for the purpose of developing software to be used in connection with wearable devices developed by or for SONY ("DEVICE"). SONY and the THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS expressly reserve all rights, title and interest (including, but not limited to, all intellectual property rights) in and to the SOFTWARE that this EULA does not specifically grant to you.

REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS
You may not:
i.   copy, publish, adapt, redistribute, attempt to derive source code, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any of the SOFTWARE, whether in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or of the SOFTWARE unless such derivative works are intentionally facilitated by the SOFTWARE;

surgical activity).

The software, network services or other products other than SOFTWARE upon which the SOFTWARE's performance depends might be interrupted or discontinued at the discretion of the suppliers (software suppliers, service suppliers, or SONY). SONY and such suppliers do not warrant that the SOFTWARE, network services, contents or other products will continue to be available, or will operate without interruption or modification.

EXCLUDED SOFTWARE AND OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS
Notwithstanding the foregoing limited license grant, you acknowledge that the SOFTWARE may include EXCLUDED SOFTWARE. Certain EXCLUDED SOFTWARE may be covered by open source software licenses ("Open Source Components"), which means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including but not limited to any license that, as a condition of distribution of the software licensed under such license, requires that the distributor make the software 
available in source code format.  Applicable Open Source Components in the SOFTWARE are listed in Exhibit A attached hereto, together with the applicable terms and conditions governing its use. Such terms and conditions may be changed by the applicable third party at any time without liability to you. To the extent required by the licenses covering EXCLUDED SOFTWARE, the terms of such licenses will apply in lieu of the terms of this EULA. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to EXCLUDED SOFTWARE prohibit any of the restrictions in this EULA with respect to such EXCLUDED SOFTWARE, such restrictions will not apply to such EXCLUDED SOFTWARE. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components require SONY to make an offer to provide source code in connection with the SOFTWARE, such offer is hereby made.

parties. Such content may be protected by copyright, other intellectual property laws, and/or agreements. You agree to use the SOFTWARE only in compliance with all such laws and agreements that apply to such content.  Such measures include, but are not limited to, counting the frequency of your backup and restoration through certain SOFTWARE features, refusal to accept your request to enable restoration of data, and termination of this EULA in the event of your illegitimate use of the SOFTWARE.

CONTENT SERVICE
PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE SOFTWARE IS DESIGNED TO BE USED WITH CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH ONE OR MORE CONTENT SERVICES ("CONTENT SERVICE"). USE OF THE SERVICE AND THAT CONTENT IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE OF THAT CONTENT SERVICE. IF YOU DECLINE TO ACCEPT THOSE TERMS, YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE LIMITED. You acknowledge and agree that certain content and services available through the SOFTWARE may be provided by third parties over which SONY has no control. USE OF THE CONTENT SERVICE 
REQUIRES AN INTERNET CONNECTION. THE CONTENT SERVICE MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.

INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND THIRD PARTY SERVICES
You acknowledge and agree that access to certain SOFTWARE features may require an Internet connection for which you are solely responsible. Operation of the SOFTWARE may be limited or restricted depending on the capabilities, bandwidth or technical limitations of your Internet connection and service.

EULA SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY ABOVE APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

CONSENT TO USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION, LOCATION DATA, DATA SECURITY
You acknowledge and agree that SONY and its affiliates, partners and agents may read, collect, transfer, process and store certain information collected from the SOFTWARE, including but not limited to information about (i) the SOFTWARE and (ii) the software applications, contents and peripheral devices that interact with the DEVICE and the SOFTWARE ("Information"). Information includes, but is not limited to: (1) unique identifiers relating to the DEVICE and its components; (2) performance of the DEVICE, the SOFTWARE and their components; (3) configurations of the DEVICE, the SOFTWARE and

SONY and its affiliates, partners and agents may use and disclose Information subject to applicable laws in order to improve its products and services or to provide products or services to you. Such uses include, but are not limited to: (a) administering the functionalities of the SOFTWARE; (b) to improve, service, update or upgrade the SOFTWARE; (c) improving, developing and enhancing the current and future products and services of SONY and other parties; (d) with your consent, to provide you with information about the products and services offered by SONY and other parties; (e) complying with applicable laws or regulations; and (f) with your consent and to the extent offered, providing you with 
location-based services of SONY and other parties, as indicated below. In addition, SONY retains the right to use Information to protect itself and third parties from illegal, criminal or harmful conduct.

Certain services available through the SOFTWARE may rely upon location information, including, but not limited to, the geographic location of the DEVICE. You acknowledge that for the purpose of providing such services, SONY, the THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS or their partners may collect, archive, process and use such location data, and that such services are governed by the privacy policies of SONY or such third party. By using any such services, you agree that you have reviewed the privacy policies applicable to such services and consent to such activities.

SONY, its affiliates, partners and agents will not use Information to personally identify the owner or user of the SOFTWARE without your knowledge or consent. Any use of Information will be in accordance with the privacy policies of SONY or such third 
party.  SONY's current privacy policy can be found on your local country Sony website, such as:
http://www.sony.co.jp/privacy/en/index.html
www.sony-europe.com.

Please contact applicable third parties for privacy policies relating to personally identifiable and other information you provide when you use or access third party software or services.

Information may be processed, stored or transferred to SONY, its affiliates or agents which are located in countries outside of your country of residence. Data protection and information privacy laws in certain countries may not offer the same level of protection as your country of residence and you may have fewer legal rights in relation to Information processed and stored in, or transferred to, such countries. SONY will use reasonable efforts to take appropriate technical and organizational steps to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Information, but does not warrant it will eliminate all risk of misuse of such Information.

AUTOMATIC 
UPDATE FEATURE
From time to time, SONY or the THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS may automatically update or otherwise modify the SOFTWARE, including, but not limited to, for purposes of enhancement of security functions, error correction and improvement of functions, at such time as you interact with SONY's or third parties' servers, or otherwise. Such updates or modifications may delete or change the nature of features or other aspects of the SOFTWARE, including, but not limited to, functions you may rely upon. You acknowledge and agree that such activities may occur at SONY's sole discretion and that SONY may condition continued use of the SOFTWARE upon your complete installation or acceptance of such update or modifications. Any updates/modifications shall be deemed to be, and shall constitute part of, the SOFTWARE for purposes of this EULA. By acceptance of this EULA, you consent to such update/modification.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT, WAIVER, SEVERABILITY
This EULA and SONY's privacy policy, each as amended and modified 
from time to time, together constitute the entire agreement between you and SONY with respect to the SOFTWARE. The failure of SONY to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this EULA shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any part of this EULA is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to maintain the intent of this EULA, and the other parts will remain in full force and effect.

GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this EULA. This EULA shall be governed by the laws of the applicable territory where the SOFTWARE is distributed, without regards to conflict of laws provisions. Any dispute arising out of this EULA shall be subject to the exclusive venue of the courts where the SOFTWARE is distributed, and the parties hereby consent to the venue and jurisdiction of such courts.

EQUITABLE REMEDIES
Notwithstanding 
anything contained in this EULA to the contrary, you acknowledge and agree that any violation of or non-compliance with this EULA by you will cause irreparable harm to SONY, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to SONY obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that SONY deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. SONY may also take any legal and technical remedies to prevent violation of and/or to enforce this EULA, including, but not limited to, immediate termination of your use of the SOFTWARE, if SONY believes in its sole discretion that you are violating or intend to violate this EULA. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies SONY may have at law, in equity or under contract.

TERMINATION
Without prejudice to any of its other rights, SONY may terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with any of its terms. In case of such termination, you must: (i) cease all use, and destroy any copies, of the SOFTWARE; (ii) comply with the requirements in the 
section below entitled "Your Account Responsibilities".

AMENDMENT
SONY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AMEND ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS EULA AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION BY POSTING NOTICE ON A SONY DESIGNATED WEB SITE, BY EMAIL NOTIFICATION TO AN EMAIL ADDRESS PROVIDED BY YOU, BY PROVIDING NOTICE AS PART OF THE PROCESS IN WHICH YOU OBTAIN UPGRADES/UPDATES OR BY ANY OTHER LEGALLY RECOGNIZABLE FORM OF NOTICE. If you do not agree to the amendment, you should promptly contact SONY for instructions. Your continued use of the SOFTWARE after the effective date of any such notice shall be deemed your agreement to be bound by such amendment.

THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES
Each THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIER is an express intended third-party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, each provision of this EULA with respect to the SOFTWARE of such party.

YOUR ACCOUNT RESPONSIBILITIES
Should you return the DEVICE to its place of purchase, sell or otherwise transfer the Device, or if this EULA is terminated, you are responsible 
for and must uninstall the SOFTWARE from the DEVICE and delete any and all accounts you may have established on DEVICE or are accessible through the SOFTWARE.
